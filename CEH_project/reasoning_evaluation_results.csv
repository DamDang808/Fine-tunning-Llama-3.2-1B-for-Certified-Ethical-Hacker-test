A.  Authentication
B.  Confidentiality
C.  Availability
D.  Integrity
","A.  Authentication
The use of a hash ensures that the data is not altered during transmission. It is a cryptographic technique that converts the data into a fixed-length string called a hash value. This value is then compared to a known value to ensure that the data has not been altered. This process is known as authentication. The hash value is then used to verify the integrity of the data. This process is known as integrity. Therefore, the use of a hash ensures that the data is not altered during transmission and that it is authentic and intact.
B.  Confidentiality
Confidentiality is the ability to keep information private. It ensures that only authorized individuals can access the information. The use of a hash ensures that the data is not altered during transmission and that it is authentic and intact. Therefore, the use of a hash ensures that the data is not altered during transmission and that it is authentic and intact.

through social engineering is a common tactic used by attackers to gain access to sensitive information.
It involves manipulating the victim into divulging confidential information or performing actions that
the attacker desires. This technique is often used in phishing attacks, where the attacker sends an
email or other communication that appears to be from a legitimate source, such as a company, in order to
gain access to the victim's account or information. The attacker then uses the victim's credentials to
access the victim's account or perform actions that the attacker desires.",C,A,0

","C. The scenario describes a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, which is a type of attack that aims to prevent legitimate users from accessing a system or service. The attack is designed to disrupt or prevent the functioning of a system or service, causing it to become unavailable or inaccessible to legitimate users. In this scenario, Abel launched a DoS attack by flooding the DHCP servers with forged DHCP requests, which resulted in the server being unable to issue any more IP addresses. This led to a DoS attack, as the legitimate employees were unable to access the clients network. The correct option is 'Rogue DHCP server attack' because it describes a specific type of attack that exploits a vulnerability in the DHCP protocol to gain unauthorized access to a network.

Identify the correct terminology that defines the above statement.
A.  Vulnerability Scanning
B.  Penetration Testing
C.  Security Policy Implementation
D.  Designing Network Security
","B.  Penetration Testing
The statement above describes a penetration testing methodology. Penetration testing is a method of testing a network or system to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It involves simulating an attacker's actions to identify potential weaknesses. Penetration testing is a critical component of network security because it helps to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
A vulnerability scanning tool is a software application that performs a series of automated tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in a network or system. It is a form of penetration testing that uses automated tools to simulate an attacker's actions. A vulnerability scanning tool can help identify vulnerabilities that an attacker might exploit, but it does not necessarily mean that the network or system is vulnerable to attack.
A security policy is a set of rules and guidelines that govern the behavior of network users and devices. It is a critical component of network security because it defines the acceptable use of the network and the consequences of non-compliance. A security policy can help to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or to disrupt network operations.
A design is a blueprint or template that outlines the structure and functionality of a network or system. It is a critical component of network security because it defines the architecture and design of the network or system. A design can help to ensure that the network or system is secure and efficient, and it can help to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or to disrupt network operations.

signature-based IDS?
A.  Produces less false positives

D.  Cannot deal with encrypted network traffic
","A.  Produces less false positives
B.  Can identify unknown attacks
C.  Requires vendor updates for a new threat
D.  Cannot deal with encrypted network traffic

Explanation:
An IDS is a security mechanism that monitors network traffic and alerts the network administrator when an attack is detected. An anomaly-based IDS uses machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns in network traffic. This type of IDS is more effective at detecting unknown attacks because it can learn from past attacks and adjust its behavior accordingly. An anomaly-based IDS does not require vendor updates for new threats because it is constantly learning and adapting to new attacks. It can also deal with encrypted network traffic because it does not rely on signatures for detection.
Signature-based IDS uses signatures to detect known attacks. It does not use machine learning algorithms and is less effective at detecting unknown attacks. It requires vendor updates for new threats because it relies on signatures for detection. It cannot deal with encrypted network traffic because it does not use machine learning algorithms.
The correct option is A, which states that an anomaly-based IDS produces less false positives. This is because it uses machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns in network traffic, which reduces the number of false positives. It also identifies unknown attacks because it can learn from past attacks and adjust its behavior accordingly. It does not require vendor updates for a new threat because it is constantly learning and adapting to new attacks. It can also deal with encrypted network traffic because it does not rely on signatures for detection.

B.  Modification of a request by a proxy between client and server
C.  A browser making a request to a server without the user?s knowledge
D.  A server making a request to another server without the user?s knowledge

Explanation:
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that exploits a web application's lack of authentication. A malicious user can send a request to a server without the user's knowledge, which can be used to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions. This attack can be prevented by implementing proper authentication mechanisms, such as using session cookies or tokens, which can be verified by the server before allowing the request to proceed.
A proxy is a software or hardware device that acts as an intermediary between two networks or systems. In this context, a proxy between a client and a server can be used to modify the request sent by the client, which can be used to perform CSRF attacks. A browser making a request to a server without the user's knowledge is a common scenario where a malicious user can send a request to a server without the user's knowledge, which can be used to perform CSRF attacks.
A server making a request to another server without the user's knowledge is a scenario where a malicious user can send a request to a server without the user's knowledge, which can be used to perform CSRF attacks. This scenario is similar to the scenario where a malicious user can send a request to a server without the user's knowledge, which can be used to perform CSRF attacks.
The correct option is 'A' which states that a request sent by a malicious user from a browser to a server is the primary target of CSRF attacks. The other options are incorrect because they do not address the primary target of CSRF attacks, which is a request sent by a malicious user from a browser to a server.
