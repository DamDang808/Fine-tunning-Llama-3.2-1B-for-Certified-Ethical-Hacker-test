In information security,\\nPayload is a section or part of a malicious and exploited code that causes the\\npotentially harmful activity and actions such as exploit, opening backdoors,\\nand hijacking.\\nBot\\nThe bots are software that is used to control the target remotely and to\\nexecute predefined tasks. It is capable to run automated scripts over the\\ninternet. The bots are also known as for Internet Bot or Web Robot.  These\\nBots can be used for Social purposes such as Chatterbots, Commercial\\npurpose or intended Malicious Purpose such as Spambots, Viruses, and\\nWorms spreading, Botnets, DDoS attacks.\\nElements of Information Security\\nConfidentiality\\nWe want to make sure that our secret and sensitive data is secure.\\nConfidentiality means that only authorized persons can work with and see our\\ninfrastructure’s digital resources. It also implies that unauthorized persons\\nshould not have any access to the data. There are two types of data in general:\\ndata in motion as it moves across the network and data at rest, when data is in\\nany media storage (such as servers, local hard drives, cloud). For data in\\nmotion, we need to make sure data encryption before sending it over the\\nnetwork. Another option we can use along with encryption is to use a\\nseparate network for sensitive data. For data at rest, we can apply encryption\\nat storage media drive so that no one can read it in case of theft.\\nIntegrity\\nWe do not want our data to be accessible or manipulated by unauthorized\\npersons. Data integrity ensures that only authorized parties can modify data.\\nAvailability\\nAvailability applies to systems and data. If authorized persons cannot get the\\ndata due to general network failure or denial-of-service(DOS) attack, then\\nthat is the problem as long as the business is concerned. It may also result in\\nloss of revenues or recording some important results.\\nWe can use the term \\n“CIA”\\n to remember these basic yet most important\\nsecurity concepts.\\n \\nCIA\\nRisk\\nControl\\nConfidentiality\\nLoss of privacy.\\nUnauthorized access to\\ninformation.\\nIdentity theft.\\nEncryption.\\nAuthentication. Access\\nControl\\nIntegrity\\nInformation is no longer reliable\\nor accurate. Fraud.\\nMaker/Checker. Quality\\nAssurance.\\nAudit Logs\\nAvailability\\nBusiness disruption. Loss of\\ncustomer’s confidence. Loss of\\nrevenue.\\nBusiness continuity.\\nPlans and test. Backup\\nstorage. Sufficient\\ncapacity.\\nTable 1-01: \\nRisk and Its Protection by Implementing CIA\\nAuthenticity\\nAuthentication is the process which identifies the user, or device to grant\\nprivileges, access and certain rules and policies. Similarly, Authenticity\\nensures the authentication of certain information initiates from a valid user\\nclaiming to be the source of that information & message transactions. The\\nprocess of authentication through the combined function of identities and\\npasswords can achieve Authenticity.\\nFigure 1-1 Elements of Information Security\\nNon-Repudiation\\nNonrepudiation is one of the Information Assurance (IA) pillar which\\nguarantees the information transmission & receiving between the sender and\\nreceiver via different techniques such as digital signatures and encryption.\\nNon-repudiation is the assurance the communication and its authenticity, so\\nthe sender cannot deny from what he sent. Similarly, the receiver cannot deny\\nfrom receiving. Digital contracts, signatures and email messages use\\nNonrepudiation techniques.\\nThe Security, Functionality, and Usability Triangle\\nIn a System, Level of Security is a measure of the strength of the Security in\\nthe system, Functionality, and Usability. These three components are known\\nas the Security, Functionality and Usability triangle. Consider a ball in this\\ntriangle, if the ball is centered, it means all three components are stronger, on\\nthe other hand, if the ball is closer to security, it means the system is\\nconsuming more resources for security and feature and function of the system\\nand Usability requires attention. A secure system must provide strong\\nprotection along with offering all services and features and usability to the\\nuser.\\nFigure 1-2 Security, Functionality & Usability Triangle\\nImplementation of High level of Security typically impacts the level of\\nfunctionality and usability with ease. The system becomes nonuser-friendly\\nwith a decrease in performance. While developing an application,\\ndeployment of security in a system, Security experts must keep in mind to\\nmake sure about functionality & ease of usability. These three components of\\na triangle must be balanced.\\nInformation Security Threats and Attack Vectors\\nMotives, Goals, and Objectives of Information Security Attacks\\nIn the information security world, an attacker attacks the target system with\\nthe three main components behind it. \"Motive or Objective\" of an attack\\nmakes an attacker focus on attacking a particular '"
